# Corpus Consolidation Decisions

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-09  
**Status**: In Progress

## Decision Framework

Following user directive: "Proposing Relationing is THE root. Every paper must build on it or be consolidated/deleted."

**Automated Analysis Complete**:
- Theorem extraction: 154 formal statements across 3 papers
- Uniqueness analysis: Identified statements with no/weak matches in PR
- Manifest data: `docs/statement_manifest.json`

---

## DECISION 1: formal-axioms-of-relationing.md (formerly proposing-a-reflexive-existence.md)

**Original File**: internal-theory/proposing-a-reflexive-existence.md (113KB, 2886 lines, 83 formal statements)

**Analysis**:
- 73 potentially unique statements (out of 83)
- 11 unique axioms including 3 meta-level (MakeSystem, MetaRotate, MetaFlow)
- 22 unique theorems including Cubic Return, Collapse Ordinal
- ~15 genuinely novel results not in PR

**Options Considered**:
- **Option A (Delete with extraction)**: Extract unique results into PR → REJECTED (loses formal structure)
- **Option B (Create "Meta-Reflexive Extensions")**: New paper with meta-level content → REJECTED (fragmentation)
- **Option C (Keep as formal treatise)**: Rename, add PR citations → **SELECTED**

**Rationale** (Architect-approved):
- This is NOT an early draft - it's a complementary FORMAL axiomatic presentation
- Preserves unique axiomatic numbering + meta-level theorems
- PR remains canonical narrative, this provides rigorous companion
- Avoids "duplicate canonicals" by explicit citation/dependency

**Actions Taken**:
1. ✅ Renamed: `proposing-a-reflexive-existence.md` → `formal-axioms-of-relationing.md`
2. ✅ Updated frontmatter:
   - `id = "formal-axioms-of-relationing"`
   - `title = "Formal Axiomatic Foundations of Relationing"`
   - `status = "canonical"` (elevated from draft)
   - `cites_internal = ["proposing-relationing"]`
   - `depends_on = ["proposing-relationing"]`
   - `builds_on = ["proposing-relationing"]`
   - Added topics: meta-theory, axiomatic-systems

**Lineage Established**:
```
proposing-relationing (CANONICAL ROOT)
  ↓ cited_by, depended_on_by
formal-axioms-of-relationing (CANONICAL - formal axiomatic companion)
```

**Unique Contributions Preserved**:
- Meta-level axioms: MakeSystem, MetaRotate, MetaIterate, MetaFlow, ReflexiveInfinity
- Meta-level theorems: Meta-Conservation, Reflexive Identity, Total Closure, Reflexive Unity, Global Stability
- Novel theorems: Cubic Return, Collapse Ordinal, Structural Closure under Modalities
- Formal axiomatic structure (14 axioms vs PR's 0)

## DECISION 2: constructing-relational-infinity-topoi.md (extracted from deriving-a-reflexive-infinity-topos.md)

**Original File**: internal-theory/deriving-a-reflexive-infinity-topos.md (98KB, 3059 lines, 368 sections)

**Analysis**:
- **Part I** (Lines 29-1469): "Proposing Existence" + "Deriving Residuality" - foundational logic REDUNDANT with PR
- **Part II** (Lines 1469-3059): "Constructing Cohesion" onwards - 1590 lines of NOVEL ∞-topos theory
- 0 formal statement blocks (uses prose format instead of enumerated theorems)
- Section outline extraction revealed clear boundary at line 1469

**Options Considered**:
- **Option A (Keep entire file)**: Add PR citations → REJECTED (1440 lines of redundant foundation)
- **Option B (Delete Part I, keep Part II in same file)**: Keep original filename → SUBOPTIMAL (loses context)
- **Option C (Extract Part II as new paper)**: Create "Constructing Relational ∞-Topoi" → **SELECTED**

**Rationale** (Architect-approved):
- Clean separation: Part I redundant with PR, Part II genuinely novel
- Eliminates 1440 lines of duplicate foundational material
- Part II stands alone as cohesive ∞-topos construction
- Preserves all novel contributions with PR lineage

**Actions Taken**:
1. ✅ Created: `internal-theory/constructing-relational-infinity-topoi.md` (1619 lines: 27 frontmatter + 1590 content)
2. ✅ Extracted: Lines 1469-3059 (Part II only - Constructing Cohesion through Reflexive Infinity-Topos)
3. ✅ Updated frontmatter:
   - `id = "constructing-relational-infinity-topoi"`
   - `title = "Constructing Relational ∞-Topoi"`
   - `status = "canonical"`
   - `cites_internal = ["proposing-relationing"]`
   - `depends_on = ["proposing-relationing"]`
   - `builds_on = ["proposing-relationing"]`
   - `topics = ["infinity-topos", "cohesive-topos", "homotopy-theory"]`
4. ✅ Deleted: `internal-theory/deriving-a-reflexive-infinity-topos.md`

**Lineage Established**:
```
proposing-relationing (CANONICAL ROOT)
  ↓ cited_by, depended_on_by
constructing-relational-infinity-topoi (CANONICAL - ∞-topos construction)
```

**Novel Contributions Preserved**:
- Cohesive (∞,1)-Topos construction with adjoint quadruple (Π ⊣ f ⊣ s ⊣ Γ)
- Installation of RT as internal bireflective core
- Stratified Directed ∞-Geometry (SD-sites, Reedy-like factorization)
- SD-Constructible diagrams and Ambidexterity Law
- Presheaf dynamics on directed sites
- Internal reconstruction of RITM (Relational Infinity-Topos Modality)
- Meta-level KZ-Comonad construction
- Complete "Reflexive Infinity-Topos" theory

## DECISION 3: relational-infinity-topos-modality.md (consolidated from 3 RITM papers)

**Original Files**:
1. relational-infinity-topos-modality.md (310 lines, 12K) - Main RITM theory
2. describing-topological-dynamics-ritm.md (95 lines, 8K) - Temporal dynamics
3. ritm-notes.md (216 lines, 12K) - Duplicate of #1

**Analysis**:
- ritm-notes.md: **Complete duplicate** (same abstract, same definitions) → DELETE
- describing-topological-dynamics-ritm.md: Coherent 95-line companion extending main paper → MERGE
- relational-infinity-topos-modality.md: Comprehensive RITM theory → KEEP as base

**Decision**: **Consolidate 3→1** (Architect-approved Option A)
- Delete ritm-notes.md (duplicate)
- Merge dynamics content into Section 8 of main paper
- Add PR lineage citations

**Actions Taken**:
1. ✅ Deleted: `ritm-notes.md` (duplicate)
2. ✅ Integrated: `describing-topological-dynamics-ritm.md` content → new Section 8 "Topological Dynamics of RITM"
3. ✅ Updated frontmatter:
   - `title = "Relational ∞-Topos Modality (RITM)"`
   - `status = "canonical"`
   - `cites_internal = ["proposing-relationing", "constructing-relational-infinity-topoi"]`
   - `depends_on = ["proposing-relationing", "constructing-relational-infinity-topoi"]`
   - `builds_on = ["constructing-relational-infinity-topoi"]`
   - Added consolidation note in frontmatter
4. ✅ Deleted: `describing-topological-dynamics-ritm.md`

**Lineage Established**:
```
proposing-relationing (CANONICAL ROOT)
  ↓
constructing-relational-infinity-topoi
  ↓
relational-infinity-topos-modality (RITM - consolidated from 3 papers)
```

**Content Integration**:
- Section 8: New "Topological Dynamics of RITM" section
  - Four-phase cycle: Expression → Certification → Reflexion → Stabilization
  - Definition of Topological Dynamics

## DECISION 4: stratified-directed-infinity-topos-geometry.md (synthesized from 2 papers)

**Original Files**:
1. introducing-stratified-directed-infinity-homotopy-geometry.md (832 lines, 36K) - Comprehensive pedagogical exposition
2. treatise-on-stratified-directed-infinity-topos-geometry.md (406 lines, 12K) - Formal axiomatic companion

**Analysis**:
- Both papers develop same theory: Stratified Directed ∞-Topos Geometry (SDIG)
- Paper 1: Rich narrative, existential framing, detailed motivation
- Paper 2: Crisp axioms, theorem statements, Parts III-VII structure
- Relationship: Paper 1 = comprehensive exposition; Paper 2 = formal companion

**Decision**: **Synthesize 2→1** (Architect-approved Option B)
- Combine Paper 1's pedagogical flow with Paper 2's formal axioms
- Create balanced canonical paper (target 500-600 lines, achieved: 359 lines)

**Actions Taken**:
1. ✅ Created `stratified-directed-infinity-topos-geometry.md` with 7 sections + references
2. ✅ Updated frontmatter: `status = "canonical"`, PR/RITM citations, consolidation note
3. ✅ Converted all HTML artifacts → clean Markdown
4. ✅ Deleted both original papers

**Lineage Established**: PR → RITM → SDIG

**Novel Contributions Preserved**: Complete SDIG framework, Ambidextrous Invariance (hlim ≃ hcolim), Verdier duality, dynamic coherence, connection to Relationing theory

## DECISION 5: Foundations Papers Lineage (3 papers - no consolidation)

**Papers Reviewed**:
1. formal-axioms-of-relationing.md (2886 lines) - Already canonical with PR lineage ✓
2. foundations-of-relation.md (1228 lines) - Missing lineage citations ❌
3. relational-posets.md (393 lines) - Missing lineage citations ❌

**Analysis**:
- **formal-axioms**: Formal axiomatic treatment (already handled in Decision 1)
- **foundations-of-relation**: Conceptual derivation from existence → differentiation → relation → reflexive stability (8 phases)
- **relational-posets**: Technical algebraic model using Heyting algebras, nuclei, presheaf cell

**Overlap Assessment**: Low - three complementary papers serving different purposes
- formal-axioms: Axiomatic foundations with meta-level axioms
- foundations-of-relation: Philosophical + mathematical conceptual development
- relational-posets: Technical algebraic prototype/model

**Decision**: **Keep separate, add PR lineage** (Architect-approved)
- Three-paper foundation stack: axioms → conceptual derivation → technical model
- No consolidation (would create unwieldy >1600 line mega-paper)
- Different audiences: philosophical vs technical

**Actions Taken**:
1. ✅ **foundations-of-relation.md**:
   - Updated `status = "canonical"` (from "draft")
   - Added `cites_internal = ["proposing-relationing", "formal-axioms-of-relationing"]`
   - Added `depends_on = ["proposing-relationing"]`
   - Added `builds_on = ["formal-axioms-of-relationing"]`
   - Enhanced topics with modal-theory, comonads

2. ✅ **relational-posets.md**:
   - Updated `status = "canonical"` (from "draft")
   - Changed `document_type = "technical_companion"` (from "paper")
   - Added `cites_internal = ["proposing-relationing", "relational-infinity-topos-modality"]`
   - Added `depends_on = ["proposing-relationing"]`
   - Added `builds_on = ["relational-infinity-topos-modality"]` (presheaf cell connection)
   - Enhanced topics with heyting-algebras, nuclei, presheaf-topos
   - Added notes explaining technical prototype role

**Lineage Established**:
```
proposing-relationing (ROOT)
  ↓
  ├─→ formal-axioms-of-relationing (axiomatic layer)
  │     ↓
  │   foundations-of-relation (conceptual derivation)
  │
  └─→ relational-infinity-topos-modality (RITM)
        ↓
      relational-posets (algebraic prototype)
```

**Foundation Stack**: Three canonical papers with clear separation of concerns

---

## DECISION 6: Explorations Papers - No Consolidation (2 papers)

**Papers Reviewed**:
1. composing-proposing-a-relational-existence.md (241 lines)
2. proposing-a-modality-of-relationing-existence.md (240 lines)

**Analysis**:

1. **composing-proposing-a-relational-existence.md**:
   - **Type**: Style guide / writing protocol (NOT research content)
   - **Content**: Prescriptive guidelines for composing relationing papers
   - **Structure**: "Internal vs External faces", proof construction, interlock verification
   - **Purpose**: Meta-document about how to write in relationing style

2. **proposing-a-modality-of-relationing-existence.md**:
   - **Type**: Independent exploratory treatise
   - **Content**: Alternative/parallel development of relationing via modal formalism
   - **Structure**: 5-part system (Logical Origination → Structural Stabilization → Directed Dynamics → Geometric Cohesion → Meta-Reflexivity)
   - **Relationship to PR**: Shares vocabulary but represents independent exploration

**Decision**: **Keep both as independent explorations, no PR lineage** (Architect-approved)
- User directive: Papers not connecting to core (PR) are acceptable in explorations/
- Both papers are intentionally independent of PR lineage
- composing-* is documentation, not research
- modality-* is parallel/alternative formulation, not derivative

**Actions Taken**:

1. ✅ **composing-proposing-a-relational-existence.md**:
   - Updated `status = "active"` (from "draft")
   - Changed `document_type = "style_guide"` (from "note")
   - Added topics: writing-protocol, composition, documentation
   - Added note: "Future consideration: Merge into docs/CORPUS_STYLE_GUIDE.md"
   - **NO PR lineage** (documentation, not research)

2. ✅ **proposing-a-modality-of-relationing-existence.md**:
   - Updated `status = "exploratory"` (from "draft")
   - Changed `document_type = "exploratory_treatise"` (from "foundational_treatise")
   - Added topics: modal-logic, existence, modality
   - Added note: "Independent exploratory draft... not part of canonical PR lineage"
   - **NO PR lineage** (intentionally independent exploration)

**Rationale**:
- explorations/ directory explicitly allows independent research
- No consolidation needed - both serve distinct purposes
- Documentation vs independent research, neither derivative of PR

**Future Consideration**:
- composing-* may be relocated to docs/ during documentation cleanup
